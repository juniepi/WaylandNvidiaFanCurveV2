# Wayland x Nvidia FanCurveV2
**``🌡️🔥 /Basic Information/ ❄️🌡️``**

Hi Hi ^^ After making the originial Wayland Nvidia FanCurve Project it worked fine but i wanted it to be more aesthetically pleasing! So me and some friends including  [Kyle Ouellette](https://github.com/kyouellette) who does amazing work might i add, Came together and spent a couple hours brainstorming ways to make the code easier to manage and pleasing to look at! 

**⚠️ Warning!**

The same warnings still apply as in the original project! 

- Dual GPU can **Possibly** work but i could never reccomend it espicially with this version!
- No water cooled GPU's this will break your graphics card! No water blocks or AIO coolers!
- Make sure your labels(which will be explained later) match up to **YOUR** system!

Make sure you follow these warnings or it could result in GPU Failure!
